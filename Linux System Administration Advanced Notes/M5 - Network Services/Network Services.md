## DNS

## Domain Name System (DNS)

- Hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to a network
- DNS name server is a server that stores the DNS records for a domain
- DNS name server responds with answers to queries against its database
- DNS database is traditionally stored in a structured text file, the zone file
- BIND, DNSMasq, Unbound, djbDNS, PowerDNS
- nslookup, dig, host
- Four basic types: master, slave, caching-only, and forwarding-only

## DNS Record Types

- SOA - Start of Authority
- A - Host address IPv4 (host to address)
- PTR - Pointer (address to host)
- TXT - Descriptive text
- NS - Name Server
- AAAA - Host address IPv6 (Host to address)
- MX - Mail Exchange
- CNAME - Canonical name

# Directory Services

## Lightweight Directory Services

- A directory service is just a database
- Popular implementations include Microsoft Active Directory, OpenLDAP, 389 Directory Server, ect.
- Usually acts as a central repository for login names, passwords, and other account attributes
- Data is organized in entries. Each entry consists of a set of named attributes
- Common attribute names are organization (o), organizational unit (ou), common name (cn), domain component (dc), etc.

## OpenLDAP

- slapd is the standard LDAP server daemon
- slurp runs on the master and handles replication to slaves in environments with multiple OpenLDAP servers
- slappasswd is used to generate passwords
- /etc/openldap/slapd.conf
- /etc/openldap/ldap.conf

## 389 Directory Server

- Alternative to OpenLDAP with better documentation, support and active development
- Multi-master replication
- Active Directory users and groups synchronization
- Graphical console for users, groups, and server management

## Kerberos

- Ticket-based authentication system with symmetric key cryptography
- Used as part of Microsoft Active Directory and Windows authentication
- krb5.conf, kdc.conf, kadm5.acl
- klist, kinit, kpasswd

## System Security Services Daemon (sssd)

- Provides authentication, account mapping, credentials caching, etc. 
- Available for both Linux and FreeBSD
- Supports authentication both through LDAP and Kerberos
- Service: sssd
Config file: sssd.conf
