# Machine Learning with JavaScript

# Problem Solving Process

- Identify data that is relevant to the problem
    - 'Features' are categories of data points that affec the value of a 'label'
- Assemble a set of data related to the problem you're trying to solve
    - Datasets almost alwasy cleanup or formatting
- Decide on the type of output you are predicting
    - Regression used with continious values, classification used with discrete values
- Based on type of output, pick an algorithm that will determine a correlation between your 'features' and 'labels'
    - Many, many different algorithms exist, each with pros and cons
- Use model generated by algoritm to make a prediction
    - Modesl relate the value of 'features' to the value of 'labels'

## Common type of outputs

- Classification
    - The value of our labes belong to a discrete set
- Regression
    - The value of our labes belong to a continious set
